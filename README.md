# Data Analytics Project – Python, SQL & Power BI

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The objective is to convert raw business data into **clean, structured information** and generate **actionable insights** that support data-driven decision making.

The project covers data loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset represents structured business / sales data.
- It includes fields such as:
  - Date
  - Region
  - Product
  - Sales
  - Profit
- The data is initially stored in CSV format and later loaded into a relational database for querying and analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – for data loading, cleaning, and analysis  
  (Libraries: Pandas, NumPy)
- **SQL** – for querying and aggregating data  
  (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
- **Power BI** – for interactive data visualization and dashboards
- **MS Excel** – for initial data review
- **PowerPoint** – for presenting insights and results

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported raw CSV data into Python using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and corrected data types to improve data quality.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed sales trends, regional performance, and product-wise metrics using Python.

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Stored cleaned data in a SQL database.
   - Used SQL queries such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOIN to extract insights.

5. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters and slicers for dynamic analysis.

6. **Reporting**
   - Summarized insights in a report and created a PPT to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Sales and profit performance overview
- Region-wise and product-wise analysis
- Time-based trend analysis
- Interactive filters for easy data exploration

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified high-performing and low-performing regions and products.
- Analyzed revenue and profit trends over time.
- Highlighted business opportunities and improvement areas.
- Demonstrated how data analytics can support strategic business decisions.
